In the digital age, secure communication is crucial in protecting people’s privacy and preventing unauthorized access to information. A typical solution is to utilize a secret key, a piece of information used in cryptography to encrypt and decrypt messages. However, powerful computers threaten the security of traditional cryptography by quickly deciphering secret keys. Quantum key distribution (QKD) solves this problem by relying on the properties of quantum mechanics rather than the key’s intricacy to protect information. To detect eavesdroppers, the parties can calculate the qubit error rate (QBER), which represents the percentage of incorrect qubits in their secret key. A higher QBER indicates a greater sensitivity to interceptions. While past studies have proved the security of several QKD protocols theoretically, they have yet to simulate them in a real-world environment. I simulated the BB84 protocol and an entanglement-based protocol using the Qiskit library in Python. To simulate the noise of actual quantum channels, I used the imbq_vigo noise model, which mimics the error mechanisms of an actual quantum computer. I tested both protocols 10,000 times on random 50-bit keys in ideal and noisy environments. I also experimented with varying lengths of keys and verified that the QBER is independent of the key’s length. My results verified my theoretical calculations, with only a 0.11% difference for the BB84 protocol and a 0.15% difference for the entanglement-based protocol. My simulations confirmed both protocols’ security and demonstrated their feasibility on unideal quantum computers, bringing them closer to real-world implementation.
